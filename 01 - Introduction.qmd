# Course Organization

## Course Instructor

**Tommaso Schettini**, assistant professort at MIAE.

*mail*: `tommaso.schettini@concordia.ca`

*office hours*: Wednesday 2PM -- 3PM, EV 4.217

::: {.infobox}
If you are not available during office hours, please send me an email to arrange an alternative meeting.
:::

## Course Logistics

Grade components:

  - 20% Quizes
  - 30% Midterm
  - 50% Final

::: {.infobox}
A score of at least 50% in the final is **required** to pass the course.
:::

## Quizes and Midterm {.smaller}

The midterm and the quizes will be held **during the usual class hours**.

The **tentative** schedule for the quizes and midterm is the following:

- Midterm - replaces the class of week 6 (before the break)
- Quiz 1 - beginning of the class of week 3
- Quiz 2 - beginning of the class of week 8

::: {.infobox}
**Note**: After the quizes class will continue as usual

# Why this course?

## Goals

The goal of this course is simple:

::: {.infobox}
To give you the **tools to handle uncertainty** in engineering systems.
:::

## Uncertainty in Industrial Engineering

::: {.incremental}
* **Demand**: How many customers will arrive tomorrow?
* **Lead times**: Will the supplier deliver on schedule?
* **Machine failures**: When will equipment break down?
* **Processing times**: How long will each job take?
* **Quality**: What fraction of products will be defective?
* **Energy & transportation**: Travel times, fuel prices, weather impacts
:::

## The Newsvendor Problem

A single-product retailer must choose how much inventory to stock:

* Too **much** → unsold goods → **waste**
* Too **little** → missed sales → **lost revenue**

::: {.infobox}
The **optimal order quantity** depends on the **distribution** of demand,
not just the average demand.
:::

This is one of the classic **stochastic optimization** problems.

## More Examples in Industrial Engineering

::: {.incremental}
* **Staff scheduling** under uncertain absenteeism
* **Queuing systems**: call centers, hospitals, assembly lines
* **Transportation**: travel-time variability, demand spikes
* **Supply chains**: multi-stage networks with stochastic disruptions
* **Project management**: uncertain task durations, PERT analysis
* **Reliability & maintenance**: failure models, preventive maintenance policies
:::

## Why ML Needs Probability & Statistics

Machine learning = learning **rules** from **past examples**  
to make **good predictions** on the future.

- Past data: fixed observations from the real world  
- Future data: unknown, uncertain  

Probability & statistics give us the tools to  
**abstract from the past** and **reason about the future**:

## Probability {.smaller}

Probability is the mathematics that studies uncertainty.  
It aims to compute the **likelihood** of certain events.

**Example**:

- Given a standard deck of cards, what is the probability I draw an **Ace**?
- How many cards should I draw on average before drawing an **Ace**?

## Statistics {.smaller}

Statistics is the science of **learning** from data.

::: {.infobox}
**Example**:

- You collect data on the heights of 100 students.
- What is the **average height**?
- Can you estimate the **average height** of all students at the university?
- Are the students at Concordia on average taller compared to the students at Mc Gill?
:::

## Summarizing

Probability and statistics are two sides of the same coin.

- **Probability** goes from models ➜ data
- **Statistics** goes from data ➜ models

The first part of this course will deal with **Probability**, the second part will deal with **Statistics**.
